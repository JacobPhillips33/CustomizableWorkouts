Customizable Workouts is an ASP.NET Core MVC Application that allows you to choose from over 1,300 exercises to make yourself a list of favorite exercises and/or create, customize, and delete as many workouts as you want. Each workout utilizes CRUD functionality to add or remove specific exercises as well as update the sets, reps, and weight. Don't be overwhelmed by having to look through so many exercises as the search and sort features allow you to sort and/or filter by exercise name, body part, target muscle, and necessary equipment. Time to get fit!
